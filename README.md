## What CAClaw is

CAClaw is a **Chartered Accountant add-on for OpenClaw**.

It helps OpenClaw support recurring professional work such as:

- GST working and review
- TDS working and follow-up
- income-tax preparation support
- audit planning and evidence tracking
- financial reporting checklists
- ROC and company-law compliance support

This is **not** a separate app.
It is an **add-on plugin** you install into OpenClaw.

So the model is simple:

- **OpenClaw** remains the main product
- **CAClaw** is the CA specialization layer
- a CA can use OpenClaw in a more structured, practical way

---

## Who CAClaw is for

CAClaw is for:

- individual Chartered Accountants
- CA firms
- article assistants working under CA supervision
- teams that want reusable checklists, prompts, review structures, and follow-up workflows

If you already use OpenClaw and want it to feel more useful for real CA work, CAClaw is for you.

## Important boundary

CAClaw is designed to **assist** CA work, not to replace review or sign-off.

- replace audit judgment
- replace legal review

Think of it as a well-organized CA assistant layer inside OpenClaw.

---

## Before you install

Before using CAClaw, you need:

1. **OpenClaw installed and working**
2. access to your terminal on the system where OpenClaw runs
3. Git installed if you want to clone this repository directly from GitHub

First confirm OpenClaw is available:

```bash
openclaw --help
```

## How to install from GitHub into OpenClaw

This is the simplest GitHub-based setup.

### Step 1: clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shaileshopenclaw/CAClaw.git
cd CAClaw
```

### Step 2: install CAClaw into OpenClaw

From inside the cloned folder, run:

```bash
openclaw plugins install .
```

This tells OpenClaw to install the plugin from the current local folder.

### Step 3: enable CAClaw

```bash

```

### Step 4: inspect the install

```bash
openclaw plugins inspect caclaw
```

You should see the plugin metadata and the CA skill pack.

### Step 5: restart the OpenClaw gateway

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

After restart, CAClaw is available inside OpenClaw.

### Optional: link mode for a working checkout

If you want OpenClaw to use this folder directly without copying it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shaileshopenclaw/CAClaw.git
cd CAClaw
openclaw plugins install -l .
openclaw plugins enable caclaw
openclaw plugins inspect caclaw
openclaw gateway restart
```

This is useful if you want to keep updating your local checkout.

```bash
openclaw plugins list
openclaw plugins inspect caclaw
